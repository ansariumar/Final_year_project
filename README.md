## Bugs

sometime the login button appear even if the user is  logged in

If you have added images of steps, and want to delete on of the images, you can't, you have to delete then whole product and then add the images again.

Some images of the steps do not render.

When you are deleting the product subimages, there will be an image in the last whose photo won't render and thats the Product's main image, delete it and the system crashes 


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm dead inside and have no intentions whatsoever to fix this project

I submitted this Project 2 days before the submission date, and the teacher said "Add this functionality", that day was also friend's bday so I was eating at the restaurent with them with the tension of comleting a feature in mere 12 hours(my friends were not my teammates)

long story short, started working on that feature at 12 AM and finished it by 4 AM and took a very satisfied sleep
